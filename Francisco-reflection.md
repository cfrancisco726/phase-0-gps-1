What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with merge conflicts and fetch.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I got some clarity with merge conflicts thanks to Tim. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?  
I asked my pair for help with some of the command syntax and merge conflict issues.  I had an issue with committing and pushing one of the files that my guide Maria helped with.  

What still confuses you about Git?
Im still not completely sure how fetch works. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
At first it felt a little unorganized and slow just to get on the same page.  I didn't feel like I was prepared for the session but it turned out to be a good experience.  I was able to learn some things from my pair.   While it may have taken some time to get through this session we were able to communicate well and get through the task.
