# Reflection from Timothy Villeroz

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* Fetch, Multiple Branches and when and how to delete them?
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* When and how to delete multiple branches
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* Simple check in with my pair. Asked Maria (the guide) how and when to delete branches.
What still confuses you about Git?
* I have a pretty good understanding of Git so no questions that I know of for now!
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* Working with someone and communicating with another takes a decent amount of time rather than just completing the assignment by yourself. Though there was a knowledge gap, the work done helps review myself of everything I have learned and also clarifies concepts rather than just knowing but understand. For getting a task finished, this may be time constraining, especially if the pairs have a knowledge gap. For understanding concepts and getting a better foundation in coding, this is a great session!
